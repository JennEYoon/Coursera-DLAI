# Week 9, class 3 notes.  
No Jupyter notebook for class 3.  
Keep my own notes here.  

## Key Concepts   
Understand what multi-task learning and transfer learning are.  
Recognize bias, variance and data-mismatch by looking at the performances of your algorithm on train/dev/test sets.  

### train/dev/test data  
train -- main input data used to train a model.  
dev -- sample evaluation data used for twicking model parameters.    
test -- final holdout data, do NOT use during model building or parameter setting.  



Note: Kaggle competitions use hidden final test dataset to evaluate winning submission.  This set is never disclosed to the public to prevent accidental overfitting to model.
