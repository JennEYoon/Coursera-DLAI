### My Meetup Hangout call notes - April 2020  

Recall
> True Positive Guess (<total possible guesses) div True Positive + Guess Negatives (true neg + false neg) 
Low false negative.  Same as **Sensitivity**  

Precision  
> True Positive div Total Positives  
Low false positive  
Same as **Specificity**  

F1 Score is Harmonic Mean  

Avoidable Bias -> diff from Bayes and diff 
Perfect - Bayes.
